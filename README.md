# dotfiles
Just some custom dotfiles I use in WSL at work.

There is a zshsrc file - I use it with oh-my-zsh
There is a .tmux.conf file that I use in conjunction with tmux tpm and the plugins referenced in the file
There is a custom zsh theme for oh-my-zsh and by customer I mean I took an existing one and made a few color and display tweaks so it would look the way I wanted it to.
